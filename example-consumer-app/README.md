# Lunar example consumer app 

This simple Python application fetches a random cat fact from the web when the user presses Enter using the Lunar-Proxy.

## Installation

Before running the app, ensure you have Python installed on your computer. This app is compatible with Python 3.x versions.

### Setting up the Environment

 **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project's root directory and run the following command to install the required Python packages:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```

  ### Important Note

  - When you are ready to try using the Lunar Proxy and Lunar Interceptor, make sure to remove the commented out line of the import `lunar_interceptor` in the code. This will enable the Lunar Interceptor to intercept and modify the requests made by the app.
